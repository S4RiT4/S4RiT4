- 👋 Hi, I’m Sarita
- 👀 I’m interested in CyberSecurity and Python
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics, specially in CyberSecurity
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on little projects that require hard work but ideally to learn from them as much as I can.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can send me any ideas over sferrater@uoc.edu and I'll gladly read them!
